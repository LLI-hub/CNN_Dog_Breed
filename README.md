## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Overview <a name="motivation"></a>

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
In this project, I have learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. 

If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Here is an example!

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

### Instructions to run this proyect

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/LLI-hub/CNN_Dog_Breed.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Download the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. Open the notebook.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```
